  sudo apt-get install nodejs
  ```
  ```
  sudo apt-get install npm
  ```

  Then you can setup the project in your local

  ```
  npm install
  ```
  ```
  bower install
  ```

  To execute the UI project in your local box you have to run the grunt command

  grunt server
  ```

  This command will compile the entire project, run the express server
  and watch for any changes to restart the process.
